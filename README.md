# Heart-Disease-Prediction-

Heart Disease Prediction - Using Sklearn, Seaborn & Graphviz Libraries of Python & UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Apr 2020

Project descriptionFirst task was to analyze and visualize data of UCI Heart Disease Dataset using the Seaborn, Graphviz and Matplotlib libraries of Python. And then it was followed by the Splitting , Training ,and Classification of Heart Disease using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithms using Sklearn Library of the Python and then finding the respective accuracies ,recalls,precision scores of all the three models and then the final task was to find the best Algorithm for the used dataset, which turn on to be the Random Forest model with an accuracy of 84.31 % and the accuracies of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree were 83.17 %, 73.12 %.
